# Sphinx test repo

For full Sphinx documentation visit [sphinx-docs.org](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/).

## First impressions

More complicated than MkDocs to set up. Sphinx seems more fully-featured maybe but also more complicated and the documentation is less approachable. I'm really missing the auto-reloading dev server from MkDocs.

Overall now that I've used MkDocs as well, I prefer it to Sphinx.

## Commands

`make html` - build site into `build` directory
